## Project Title
Campus Bridge – Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

## 📌 Selected Domain
Web development

## ❓ Problem Statement / Use Case
Many educational institutions struggle to efficiently manage academic workflows, student performance, and practical coding skills within a single system. Existing platforms often separate LMS features from technical skill-building tools, causing inefficiencies and limited student engagement. There is a need for an integrated solution that streamlines academic management and empowers students with real-time coding practice and AI-based support.

## 📝 Abstract / Problem Description
**Campus Bridge** is a unified web-based platform designed to integrate core features of a Learning Management System (LMS) with a dedicated coding skill development environment. It aims to address the gap between academic administration and hands-on technical training.  

The LMS component includes features like subject-wise student attendance tracking, performance monitoring, material sharing, and assignment management. The coding module offers an in-browser code editor supporting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with animated background themes to enhance user experience. It also provides curated coding challenges and mock tests to strengthen student programming skills.  

AI-powered features like automatic code evaluation, personalized feedback, and language assistance further support students in their learning journey. The platform targets colleges and universities, aiming to streamline teaching workflows while enhancing student outcomes through interactive and real-time tools.  

By combining LMS utilities with a smart coding environment, **Campus Bridge** creates a one-stop solution to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the academic ecosystem.
